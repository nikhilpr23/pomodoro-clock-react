# Pomodoro Clock

> A Pomodoro kitchen timer, after which the method is named **The Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named *Pomodoros*.
